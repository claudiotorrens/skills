# Windows Notifier

Send a local **Windows desktop toast notification** on this machine.

This skill is a Windows-focused alias/wrapper around the shared desktop notification flow so agents can trigger a popup consistently when the user asks for a Windows reminder or when a reminder/alert should not rely only on chat visibility.

## Use this skill for

- Local reminder popups
- Timer / study / schedule alerts
- Attention-needed notifications when chat may be in the background
- Windows-specific notification tests

## Command

Run this from PowerShell with `exec`:

```powershell
node "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw\workspace\skills\windows-notifier\scripts\send-notification.js" --title "<TITLE>" --message "<MESSAGE>" --timeout 10
```

Optional flags:

- `--wait true|false`
- `--timeout <seconds>`
- `--sound true|false` (default: `true`)

## Notes

- Keep the title short and the message concise.
- Prefer this over chat-only reminders when the request is for a local popup.
- If a reminder or alert may be missed because OpenClaw is running in the background, prefer triggering this notifier in addition to or instead of chat delivery, depending on user intent.
- Uses `node-notifier` for the popup appearance and behavior.
- On first run after install, the script auto-installs dependencies in this skill directory if needed, so users do not need to run npm manually.
